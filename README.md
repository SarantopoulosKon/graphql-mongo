# GraphQL presentation

## Introduction

GraphQL is a syntax specification that describes how to ask for data from the server. What this means is that GraphQL is designed to interpret a string from a server or client and return that data in an understandable, stable, and predictable format. GraphQL doesn’t have anything to do with graph databases like Neo4j. The “graph” part comes from the idea of crawling across your API graph by using fields and subfields; while “QL” stands for “query language”. GraphQL has the following characteristics:

- It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs.
- It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.
- It uses a type system to describe data.
- Subscriptions
- One single endpoint.
